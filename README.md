## Installation

To install use pip:

```bash
xpip install xontrib-prompt-starship
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/anki-code/xontrib-prompt-starship
```

## Usage

```bash
xontrib load prompt_starship
```

## Recommendation

We suggest to use `@` character to remember about you're using xonsh syntax and to potentially spread the word about xonsh if you make a screenshot or show your terminal to friends or collegues. Add this to your `~/.config/starship.toml`:
```ini
[character]
success_symbol = "[@](bold green)"
error_symbol = "[@](bold red)"
```
If you're using Starship for both for another shell and for xonsh and you want to have different characters you can just put the lines above to the new `~/.config/starship_xonsh.toml` file. Then you should add to the `~/.xonshrc` file the line `$STARSHIP_CONFIG = '~/.config/starship_xonsh.toml'` before `xontrib load prompt_starship`.
